# High-Level Overview of Nomic's Bitcoin Bridge

Nomic is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that acts as a decentralized custodian for Bitcoin. It allows users to lock their Bitcoin and, in return, mint a pegged token called `nBTC` on the Nomic chain. This `nBTC` token can then be transferred to other IBC-compatible chains, such as Osmosis, enabling Bitcoin to be used in the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

*   **nBTC:** A fully collateralized, 1:1 pegged representation of Bitcoin on the Nomic chain. For every `nBTC` that exists, there is a corresponding Bitcoin locked in a decentralized, multi-signature wallet controlled by the Nomic validators.
*   **Decentralized Custody:** Unlike centralized bridges that rely on a trusted third party to hold custody of the locked assets, Nomic uses a decentralized custody model. The locked Bitcoin is held in a multi-signature wallet, and the keys are distributed among the Nomic validators. This removes the single point of failure and reduces the risk of censorship.
*   **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC):** Nomic is an IBC-compatible chain, which means it can seamlessly communicate with other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem. This is the mechanism through which `nBTC` is transferred to other chains, such as Osmosis.

## The Bridging Process

The process of moving Bitcoin to Osmosis via the Nomic bridge can be broken down into two main parts: depositing Bitcoin to mint `nBTC`, and transferring `nBTC` to Osmosis.

### Depositing Bitcoin to Mint nBTC

1.  **Generate a Deposit Address:** The user generates a unique, one-time Bitcoin deposit address. This address is generated by the Nomic bridge and is tied to the user's Nomic account.
2.  **Deposit Bitcoin:** The user sends Bitcoin to the generated deposit address.
3.  **Confirmation:** The Nomic validators monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for incoming deposits. Once the transaction has received a sufficient number of confirmations, the validators sign a transaction on the Nomic chain to mint an equivalent amount of `nBTC` to the user's Nomic account.

### Transferring nBTC to Osmosis

1.  **Initiate an IBC Transfer:** The user initiates an IBC transfer of their `nBTC` from the Nomic chain to the Osmosis chain.
2.  **Packet Forwarding:** The IBC relayer picks up the transfer packet and forwards it to the Osmosis chain.
3.  **Receive nBTC on Osmosis:** The Osmosis chain receives the IBC packet and mints a new, IBC-denominated `nBTC` token to the user's Osmosis account. This token can then be used in the various DeFi applications on Osmosis.
